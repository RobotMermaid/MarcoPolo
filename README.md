# MarcoPolo
An app that tells you who's home through the router

#Summary  
Devices can be used to monitor the activity of people in an environment. This tool will monitor the attached devices and provide a notification system. This will be first used to make requests to web APIs and later to connect to other IoT displays.
#Goals  
Monitor network attached devices via Ruby webserver on a raspberry pi. When a device is added or removed from the network send notifications to configured APIs.
